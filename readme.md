RPG-ish text-based choose your own adventure game. Main runs everything. It's probably best to go to the Town Square 
first the first time you go into Town. Capitalization doesn't matter in text entry, but if you enter something that 
isn't an expected response it will just ignore it and carry on. It won't break or prompt you to retry the entry, it'll 
just carry on.
